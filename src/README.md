# Causely Grafana Plugin

**Causely** delivers instant value with no complex setup or configuration. It shifts your organization from reactive to proactive operations. Instead of a flood of alerts, Causely tells you exactly what you need to know about active and emerging application failures â€” including why a failure happened, what the root cause was, and how to fix it.

## Overview / Introduction

The [Causal AI platform][1] supercharges your observability stack by using built-in intelligence to analyze your telemetry data. It enables **self-managed, resilient applications** by integrating observability with automated orchestration.

Use Causely to:

- **Assure continuous application reliability**: Ensure KPIs, SLAs, SLOs, and SLIs are consistently met to maintain reliability and performance.
- **Improve operational efficiency**: Reduce labor, data, and tooling costs by accelerating Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) and streamlining operational processes.
- **Accelerate feature delivery and innovation**: Increase the speed and reliability of shipping new services and features, helping you maintain a competitive edge.

Causely integrates with Grafana to provide **automated root cause analysis** based on OpenTelemetry signals. It uses OTEL Traces and Metrics as inputs to the Causal AI reasoning platform, identifying the root causes of anomalies and alerts. The **Causely Grafana Plugin** displays the identified root causes, including service impacts, in a Grafana Panel.

## Requirements
